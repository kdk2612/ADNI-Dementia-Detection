# ADNI- Dementia Detection

## MINING UNSTRUCTURED DOCTORâ€™S NOTES

Dementia is an umbrella term for many symptoms that of brain diseases or disorders. One of the major forms of dementia the Alzheimers disease is a globally rising concern, primarily due to unpredictability of the consequences and unpreparedness of the patient and patients family to deal with it. The reason behind this is that the current methods are expensive, invasive and hence painful and only support detection at later stages. Perhaps early detection may help in prolonging the symptoms and give enough time to the family and patient to deal with it. Patients could greatly benefit from improved recognition of early dementia markers. Identification of such markers can be possible through analysis of patients electronic health records collected over years. The main goal of this project is to develop a predictive model using the unstructured doctors notes in the electronic health records to provide an accurate prediction of the patients dementia state.
